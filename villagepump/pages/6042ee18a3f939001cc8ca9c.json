This book immediately received critical acclaim and was eventually followed by Lila: An Inquiry into Morals (1991), which introduces a value-based metaphysics called the Metaphysics of Quality (MOQ).",

There are many possible answers but the one the MOQ gives is that you can understand Quality best if you don't subordinate it to anything else but instead subordinate everything else to it.\"",
